        <p>During the pandemic, I didn't go out much. Instead, I stayed home and spent more time with my family and myself. As I spent more time with myself, I began to try out a bunch of new things. For example, I am right-handed, but over the pandemic I decided to try to learn how to write with my left hand.</p>
